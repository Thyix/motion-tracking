> ðŸ•º ðŸ’ƒ Practical Work in Computer Vision at Cegep LÃ©vis-Lauzon. Put our knowledge of OpenCV into practice to create an object tracking program. ðŸ“¸  ðŸ–¼

### Detect and track real-time objects via a camera.

The goal of this project was to make it a very simple motion detector, by simply displaying objects that differed from the previous image. I added some interesting features that could be favorable for your projects, such as the detection of the direction of objects and a display of the threshold of the base image.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have following installed:

  - [x] [gcc](https://gcc.gnu.org/) with C++11 support.
  - [x] [OpenCV 3.x](http://opencv.org/downloads.html) **with contribution package**
  - [x] A Webcamera !


## Compile and run

As simple as:

```
$ make
$ bin/track
```

The tracking program runs until you press `Echap`. Tab `Ctrl + C` inside your terminal 
window to terminate.


## Disclaimer

The build is configured to perfectly fit on Windows 10 (Visual Studio Entreprise 2017). 
Your mileage may vary if you are compiling the code on a different OS.

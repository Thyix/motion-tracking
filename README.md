> ðŸ•º ðŸ’ƒ Made with OpenCV and a lot of love, this project is a simple, fast and efficient implementation of one of the many ways to make a motion detector. If you want to contribute to this project, do not hesitate to submit your ideas ðŸ“¸  ðŸ–¼

### Detect and track real-time objects via a camera

The goal of this project was to make it a very simple motion detector, by simply displaying objects that differed from the previous image. I added some interesting features that could be favorable for your projects, such as the detection of the direction of objects and a display of the threshold of the base image.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have following installed:

  - [Visual Studio 2017 Entreprise](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/fr/license-terms/mlt551018/)
  - [OpenCV 3.x](http://opencv.org/downloads.html) **with contribution package**
  - A Webcamera ! (Personnaly, I have this one ([click here](https://www.edmundoptics.com/f/high-definition-dual-hdmi-and-usb-cameras/14263/)))

## Compile and run

As simple as:

```c++
$ make
$ bin/track
```

or by debugging the whole program in **Visual Studio**

The tracking program runs until you press `Echap`. Tab `Ctrl + C` inside your terminal 
window to terminate.

## Disclaimer

The build is configured to perfectly fit on Windows 10 (Visual Studio Entreprise 2017). 
Your mileage may vary if you are compiling the code on a different OS.
